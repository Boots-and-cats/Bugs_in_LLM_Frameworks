The change addresses an issue where URL parsing resulted in incorrect base URLs for GitHub Enterprise domains, leading to inaccurate links when interacting with repositories hosted on custom or enterprise GitHub instances.\r\n\r\nChanges\r\n\r\n- New Method: Adds _get_base_url, a utility to correctly parse and extract the base URL from blob URLs. This method now properly handles both standard GitHub domains and custom GitHub Enterprise domains, as well as various edge cases.\r\n- Testing: Includes a comprehensive set of unit tests to validate the URL extraction functionality, covering standard GitHub URLs, enterprise domains, and edge cases (e.g., malformed or empty URLs).\r\n- Version Update: Increments the package version to 0.4.0\r\n\r\nFixes # (issue)\r\n\r\n## New Package?\r\n\r\nDid I fill in the `tool.llamahub` section in the `pyproject.toml` and provide a detailed README.md for my new integration or package?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [ ] No\r\n\r\n## Version Bump?\r\n\r\nDid I bump the version in the `pyproject.toml` file of the package I am updating? (Except for the `llama-index-core` package)\r\n\r\n- [x] Yes\r\n- [ ] No\r\n\r\n## Type of Change\r\n\r\nPlease delete options that are not relevant.\r\n\r\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] This change requires a documentation update\r\n\r\n## How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nYour pull-request will likely not be merged unless it is covered by some form of impactful unit testing.\r\n\r\n- [x] I added new unit tests to cover this change\r\n- [ ] I believe this change is already covered by existing unit tests\r\n\r\n## Suggested Checklist:\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have performed a self-review of my own code\r\n- [ ] I have commented my code, particularly in hard-to-understand areas\r\n- [ ] I have made corresponding changes to the documentation\r\n- [ ] I have added Google Colab support for the newly added notebooks.\r\n- [x] My changes generate no new warnings\r\n- [x] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] New and existing unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [x] I ran `make format; make lint` to appease the lint gods\r\n",

The issue results in a `TypeError: 'coroutine' object is not subscriptable`.\r\n\r\nThe error occurs due to subscripting the coroutine object: `await ctx.get(\"some_database\")[1]`.\r\n\r\nIt has been resolved by removing the subscript on the coroutine object, like this: `await ctx.get(\"some_database\")`. \r\n\r\nThis change ensures successful execution and understanding of the \"Maintaining State\" section of the documentation.\r\n### Code Changes:\r\n```\r\n- return StopEvent(result=await ctx.get(\"some_database\")[1])\r\n+ return StopEvent(result=await ctx.get(\"some_database\"))\r\n```\r\n### Motivation:\r\nThis change is necessary to fix the documentation error, which was causing confusion and execution issues when users followed the example code. By correcting the example, users will now be able to successfully understand and implement state management as intended.\r\n### Testing:\r\n- Verified that the `TypeError` no longer occurs with the updated code.\r\n- Ensured that the documentation accurately reflects the correct usage.\r\n\r\n### Related Issues:\r\n- NA.\r\n### Additional Notes:\r\n- The change aligns with the project's coding standards.",

        "body": "# Description\r\n\r\nThe previous construction of the query body for markdown and html citations required that both parameters `citations_url_pattern` and `citations_text_pattern` be provided by the user. However, we have functionality for this such that if the user only provides `citations_url_pattern` and not `citations_text_pattern`, the text displayed will be the numeric citation by default. This fix changes how the query body is built for Vectara's llama_index `VectaraRetriever` class to support this functionality.\r\n\r\nFixes: Now allows for users to only specify one of two arguments (`citations_url_pattern` is still required) for html and markdown citation styles.\r\n\r\n## Version Bump?\r\n\r\nDid I bump the version in the `pyproject.toml` file of the package I am updating? (Except for the `llama-index-core` package)\r\n\r\n- [x] Yes\r\n\r\n## Type of Change\r\n\r\nPlease delete options that are not relevant.\r\n\r\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n\r\n## How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nPlease describe the tests that you ran to verify your changes. Provide instructions so we can reproduce. Please also list any relevant details for your test configuration\r\n\r\nI added a new test to our existing test file that passes in only the `citations_url_pattern` and not the `citations_text_pattern`. I made sure that the markdown citations work as intended, displaying numbers for the text and having the correct specified url pattern.\r\n\r\n- [x] Added new unit/integration tests\r\n\r\n## Suggested Checklist:\r\n\r\n- [x] I have performed a self-review of my own code\r\n- [x] I have commented my code, particularly in hard-to-understand areas\r\n- [x] My changes generate no new warnings\r\n- [x] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [x] New and existing unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [x] I ran `make format; make lint` to appease the lint gods\r\n",

The problem is that:\r\n\r\nKeyError: 'id'\r\n\r\nOriginally, the id was taken from additional['id'].However, in databases built with Weaviate SDK and others (without Llama-index), there is no 'id' field in 'addtional' and the id is set in metadata['uuid'].\r\nChanged to get data from metadata['uuid'] if not in additional['id'].\r\n\r\nThe only files changed are the following:\r\nllama-index-integrations/vector_stores/llama-index-vector-stores-weaviate/llama_index/vector_stores/weaviate/utils.py\r\n\r\nThis is my first contribution for OSS :)\r\n\r\n\r\n## New Package?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [x] No\r\n\r\n## Version Bump?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [x] No\r\n\r\n## Type of Change\r\n\r\n\r\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n\r\n## How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\n- [x] I believe this change is already covered by existing unit tests\r\n\r\n## Suggested Checklist:\r\n\r\n- [x] I have performed a self-review of my own code\r\n- [ ] I have made corresponding changes to the documentation\r\n- [ ] I have added Google Colab support for the newly added notebooks.\r\n- [x] My changes generate no new warnings\r\n- [x] New and existing unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n",

It's contradictory.\r\n\r\nIn short, we do not need arg `id_to_text_map`, we could query with just a vector. Moreover, I align the arguments with the official Python SDK of DashVector\r\n\r\n \r\nFixes # (issue)\r\n\r\n## New Package?\r\n\r\nDid I fill in the `tool.llamahub` section in the `pyproject.toml` and provide a detailed README.md for my new integration or package?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [x] No\r\n\r\n## Version Bump?\r\n\r\nDid I bump the version in the `pyproject.toml` file of the package I am updating?

Before this PR, the streaming queue was not flushed properly in case an exception occurred, and the code would get stuck in the `async for` forever. Now we properly end streaming in case of error.\r\n\r\nIssue reported internally.",

This is useful when using tracing integrations that read the property `model_name`.\r\n* It populates the property `model_name` for embeddings models using metadata retrieval or a known value if available. Similar behavior than for LLMs. Again, this is useful when using tracing integrations.\r\n* It removes warnings from pydantic V2 migration.\r\n\r\n## New Package?\r\n\r\nDid I fill in the `tool.llamahub` section in the `pyproject.toml` and provide a detailed README.md for my new integration or package?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [x] No\r\n\r\n## Version Bump?\r\n\r\nDid I bump the version in the `pyproject.toml` file of the package I am updating? (Except for the `llama-index-core` package)\r\n\r\n- [x] Yes\r\n- [ ] No\r\n\r\n## Type of Change\r\n\r\nPlease delete options that are not relevant.\r\n\r\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] This change requires a documentation update\r\n\r\n## How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nPlease describe the tests that you ran to verify your changes. Provide instructions so we can reproduce. Please also list any relevant details for your test configuration\r\n\r\n- [x] Added new unit/integration tests\r\n- [ ] Added new notebook (that tests end-to-end)\r\n- [ ] I stared at the code and made sure it makes sense\r\n\r\n## Suggested Checklist:\r\n\r\n- [x] I have performed a self-review of my own code\r\n- [x] I have commented my code, particularly in hard-to-understand areas\r\n- [x] I have made corresponding changes to the documentation\r\n- [x] I have added Google Colab support for the newly added notebooks.\r\n- [x] My changes generate no new warnings\r\n- [x] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [x] New and existing unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [x] I ran `make format; make lint` to appease the lint gods\r\n",

Please follow the thought-action-input format. Try again.\" However, no error occurred during the tool creation process, which made this issue confusing.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nllm = OpenAI(model=\"gpt-4-turbo\", temperature=0)\r\n\r\nentry_agent = ReActAgent.from_tools(\r\n    [\r\n        weather_tool,\r\n        address_geo_tool,\r\n        web_search_tool,\r\n        gas_knowledge_tool,\r\n        # This tool fails to work because its name is in Chinese\r\n        QueryEngineTool(\r\n            query_engine=kitchen_appliance_agent,\r\n            metadata=ToolMetadata(\r\n                name=\"厨房电器推荐\",\r\n                description=\"可以根据用户的喜好推荐各种厨房电器\",\r\n            ),\r\n        ),\r\n    ],\r\n    llm=llm,\r\n    max_iterations=5,\r\n    verbose=True,\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe root cause lies in the regular expression used in `output_parser.py`, which currently limits tool names to characters in the range `a-zA-Z0-9_`. \r\n\r\nIn my opinion, this restriction is unnecessary. Additionally, since the tool name serves as a hint to the LLM, supporting multiple languages would make it more intuitive and versatile.\r\n\r\nThis PR modifies the regular expression to allow tool names to include non-English characters. The change works as expected in my case. I also added a unit test for this case.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFixes # (issue)\r\n\r\nError when parsing output if tool name contains non-English characters.\r\n\r\n## New Package?\r\n\r\nDid I fill in the `tool.llamahub` section in the `pyproject.toml` and provide a detailed README.md for my new integration or package?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [x] No\r\n\r\n## Version Bump?\r\n\r\nDid I bump the version in the `pyproject.toml` file of the package I am updating?

When chunks are absent, the relations weren't inserted. This PR fixes the logic for upserting relations accordingly.\r\n\r\nFixes external issue in Kùzu GitHub repo: https://github.com/kuzudb/kuzu/issues/4208\r\n\r\n## New Package?\r\n\r\nDid I fill in the `tool.llamahub` section in the `pyproject.toml` and provide a detailed README.md for my new integration or package?\r\n\r\n- [x] Yes\r\n- [ ] No\r\n\r\n## Version Bump?\r\n\r\nDid I bump the version in the `pyproject.toml` file of the package I am updating?

        "body": "# Description\r\nPreviously, when using the `VectorContextRetriever` with the `Neo4jPropertyGraphStore`, the `VectorContextRetriever`would call `avector_query` to get the `similarity_top_k` nodes and return the list of nodes with the first node being ranked with the highest similarity score, and the last being least similar. However, when we pass the nodes found from `avector_query` to `aget_rel_map`, the nodes returned could be in any order of similarity. So we need to fix this issue. For example, if I have a query: `nodes = retriever.retrieve(\"Andres Mendez\")`, then then resulting node ids from `avector_query` could look like the following: ['Andres Mendez', 'Andres', 'Miguel Mendez', 'Joe Mamma']. But then the results from `aget_rel_map` could provide only the top 30 results from the relationships of Joe Mamma. This is not expected behaviour, as we are querying for Andres Mendez, not Joe Mamma. The issue here is that we don't take similarity score into account when when calling aget_rel_map, but we need to.\r\n\r\nFixes # (issue)\r\nI modified the cypher query in `aget_rel_map` to return results based on the order of the node ids passed into this function. This will preserve the scores of the input nodes in the response of this function.\r\n\r\n## Version Bump?\r\n\r\nDid I bump the version in the `pyproject.toml` file of the package I am updating?

Text contains the concatenated streams of tokens returned thus far, while `.delta` contains only the latest token received from the LLM.\r\n\r\nAs a result when this line was run, instead of getting a token-by-token stream of:\r\n```\r\na computer scientist, entrepreneur, and venture capitalist.\r\n```\r\n\r\nyou'll get this long and jumbled output:\r\n```\r\naa computera computer scientista computer scientist,a computer scientist, entrepreneura computer scientist, entrepreneur,a computer scientist, entrepreneur, anda computer scientist, entrepreneur, and venturea computer scientist, entrepreneur, and venture capitalista computer scientist, entrepreneur, and venture capitalist.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe intention was likely to use `.delta` attribute, and so this PR updates the example accordingly.\r\n\r\n## Type of Change\r\n\r\nPlease delete options that are not relevant.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [x] This change requires a documentation update\r\n\r\n## How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nPlease describe the tests that you ran to verify your changes.

Also, I fixed an apparent bug in PDFReader where, when extracting the text from each PDF page and merging into a single document (i.e., when `return_full_document == True`), the page texts are naively concatenated into a single string with no separator. This will lead to situations where the last word of page 1 is literally concatenated with the first word of page 2, etc. I added a newline separator instead (open to suggestions, a simple space character might suffice).

The present solution formats the existing `file_ids` into `attachments` objects, without specifying `tools` within each `attachment`, as this is optional ([see here](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/messages/createMessage#messages-createmessage-attachments)).\r\n\r\nAnother solution could be to add an `attachments` argument to `OpenAIAssistantAgent` methods. However, the present solution would be more seamless with any existing uses (i.e. it would not require any changes to any existing uses of this agent).\r\n\r\nFixes #12968\r\n\r\n## New Package?\r\n\r\nDid I fill in the `tool.llamahub` section in the `pyproject.toml` and provide a detailed README.md for my new integration or package?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [x] No\r\n\r\n## Version Bump?\r\n\r\nDid I bump the version in the `pyproject.toml` file of the package I am updating?

But a problem will occur if the system prompt (in the prefix-messages) is quite long and in addition to the chat history, we can actually get an error regarding exceeding the context window.\r\n\r\nI should also add that the `messages_to_prompts` always expect that we have alternating `user` and `assistant` interactions and hence I wrote in a line so that when we are forgetting chat history, we delete pairs of messages so we still have these alternating messages. It's also possible to get errors if we forget chat history but we have the chat history starting with `assistant` messages in the chat history.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, I made some changes to the `ChatMemoryBuffer.get()` method by allowing you to pass in an `initial_token_count` argument which represents a kind of amount of context window to keep available and this gets added to each time we assess the token count of the chat history.\r\n\r\nI have made changes to the `context` and `simple` chat engines where we first compute the number of tokens in the prefix-messages and pass that into the `ChatMemoryBuffer.get()` method and this ensures that we do not have a resulting `all_messages` which exceeds the length.\r\n\r\nHappy to add some tests if feel necessary.\r\n\r\nFixes #7765 (this is currently closed, but I think it's still an open issue actually - see https://github.com/run-llama/llama_index/issues/7765#issuecomment-1783084918)\r\n\r\n## Type of Change\r\n\r\nPlease delete options that are not relevant.\r\n\r\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n\r\n# How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nPlease describe the tests that you ran to verify your changes.

(Except for the `llama-index-core` package)\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [x] No\r\n\r\n## Type of Change\r\n\r\nPlease delete options that are not relevant.\r\n\r\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n\r\n## How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nPlease describe the tests that you ran to verify your changes. Provide instructions so we can reproduce. Please also list any relevant details for your test configuration\r\n\r\n- [ ] Added new unit/integration tests\r\n- [x] Tested Haotian's sample code\r\n- [x] I stared at the code and made sure it makes sense\r\n",

        "body": "# Description\r\n\r\nPlease include a summary of the change and which issue is fixed. Please also include relevant motivation and context. List any dependencies that are required for this change.\r\n\r\n## 1. Motivation\r\nIn https://github.com/lavague-ai/LaVague/pull/67#issuecomment-2028849657, while comparing the OpenAI and Litellm integrations, this error was encountered when using the Litellm integration, while the OpenAI one gave no errors. \r\n```\r\n  File \"/home/vscode/.local/lib/python3.10/site-packages/llama_index/core/llms/llm.py\", line 83, in gen\r\n    for response in chat_response_gen:\r\n  File \"/home/vscode/.local/lib/python3.10/site-packages/llama_index/core/llms/callbacks.py\", line 99, in wrapped_gen\r\n    for x in f_return_val:\r\n  File \"/home/vscode/.local/lib/python3.10/site-packages/llama_index/llms/litellm/base.py\", line 276, in gen\r\n    message=ChatMessage(\r\n  File \"/home/vscode/.local/lib/python3.10/site-packages/pydantic/v1/main.py\", line 341, in __init__\r\n    raise validation_error\r\npydantic.v1.error_wrappers.ValidationError: 1 validation error for ChatMessage\r\nrole\r\n  none is not an allowed value (type=type_error.none.not_allowed)\r\n```\r\n## 2. Root Cause\r\nComparing the two `base.py` code, the difference can be seen here ( [litellm](https://github.com/run-llama/llama_index/blob/main/llama-index-integrations/llms/llama-index-llms-litellm/llama_index/llms/litellm/base.py#L284) | [OpenAI](https://github.com/run-llama/llama_index/blob/main/llama-index-integrations/llms/llama-index-llms-openai/llama_index/llms/openai/base.py#L458) ):\r\n```python\r\n# litellm integration in llama-index\r\nrole = delta.get(\"role\", \"assistant\")\r\ncontent_delta = delta.get(\"content\", \"\") or \"\"\r\n\r\n# openai integration in llama-index\r\nrole = delta.role or MessageRole.ASSISTANT\r\ncontent_delta = delta.content or \"\"\r\n```\r\n## 3. Fix\r\nThe goal of this PR is to align LiteLLM's `base.py` to follow OpenAi's. This way, the fix can be made available in the next release of `llama-index-llms-litellm` to support its integration in LaVague.\r\n\r\n## New Package?\r\n\r\nDid I fill in the `tool.llamahub` section in the `pyproject.toml` and provide a detailed README.md for my new integration or package?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [x] No\r\n\r\n## Version Bump?\r\n\r\nDid I bump the version in the `pyproject.toml` file of the package I am updating? (Except for the `llama-index-core` package)\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [x] No\r\n\r\n## Type of Change\r\n\r\nPlease delete options that are not relevant.\r\n\r\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] This change requires a documentation update\r\n\r\n## How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nPlease describe the tests that you ran to verify your changes. Provide instructions so we can reproduce. Please also list any relevant details for your test configuration\r\n\r\n- [ ] Added new unit/integration tests\r\n- [ ] Added new notebook (that tests end-to-end)\r\n- [x] I stared at the code and made sure it makes sense\r\n\r\n## Suggested Checklist:\r\n\r\n- [x] I have performed a self-review of my own code\r\n- [ ] I have commented my code, particularly in hard-to-understand areas\r\n- [ ] I have made corresponding changes to the documentation\r\n- [ ] I have added Google Colab support for the newly added notebooks.\r\n- [x] My changes generate no new warnings\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] New and existing unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I ran `make format; make lint` to appease the lint gods\r\n",

This can have significant performance implications including some performance degradations in comparison to prior SQLAlchemy versions.  Set this attribute to True if this type object's state is safe to use in a cache key, or False to disable this warning. (Background on this warning at: https://sqlalche.me/e/20/cprf)```\r\n\r\n## New Package?\r\n\r\nDid I fill in the `tool.llamahub` section in the `pyproject.toml` and provide a detailed README.md for my new integration or package?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [x] No (N/A)\r\n\r\n## Version Bump?\r\n\r\nDid I bump the version in the `pyproject.toml` file of the package I am updating? (Except for the `llama-index-core` package)\r\n\r\n- [x] Yes\r\n- [ ] No\r\n\r\n## Type of Change\r\n\r\nPlease delete options that are not relevant.\r\n\r\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] This change requires a documentation update\r\n\r\n## How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nPlease describe the tests that you ran to verify your changes. Provide instructions so we can reproduce. Please also list any relevant details for your test configuration\r\n\r\n- [ ] Added new unit/integration tests\r\n- [ ] Added new notebook (that tests end-to-end)\r\n- [x] I stared at the code and made sure it makes sense\r\n- [x] Tested my update to the 'llama-index-vector-stores-lantern' integration in my project (which is using hybrid search to query a LanternVectorStore and llama_index==v0.10.35). \r\n\r\nHow I tested this fix:\r\n- imported my modified version of the 'llama-index-vector-stores-lantern'  package into a private git repo by adding the following line in my requirements.txt:\r\n`-e git+https://github.com/nataliachodelski/llama_index.git@nataliachodelski/BUG-9522-fix-sqalchemy-warning-postgres-vector-stores#subdirectory=llama-index-integrations/vector_stores/llama-index-vector-stores-lantern&egg=llama-index-vector-stores-lantern`\r\n- I tested inserting and querying the vector store and confirmed that the SAWarning from SQLAlchemy I'd previously seen in my logs each time I performed a hybrid search in LanternVectorStore is no longer showing up. \r\n- I also tested inserting and querying my vector store with LanternVectorStore's `cache_ok` argument set to both True and False, individually of course.\r\n    - I didn't notice any difference in performance/speed when passing the `cache_ok=True` flag in my LanternVectorStore instance, but hybrid search worked as expected.\r\n-  Note: I didn't directly test the 'llama-index-vector-stores-postgres' changes in a project setting, but from my explorations, the lantern and postgres integrations appear very similar so I am confident my change will fix the error for both packages. I was experiencing an identical error message to that described in issue #9522 (which was made by a user of the postgres integration).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Suggested Checklist:\r\n\r\n- [x] I have performed a self-review of my own code\r\n- [x] I have commented my code, particularly in hard-to-understand areas\r\n- [ ] I have made corresponding changes to the documentation\r\n- [ ] I have added Google Colab support for the newly added notebooks.\r\n- [x] My changes generate no new warnings\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [x] New and existing unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [x] I ran `make format; make lint` to appease the lint gods\r\n",

        "body": "# Description\r\n\r\nThe PandasQueryEngine currently does not work if the LLM-generated query contains pandas functions, such as pd.to_datetime() or pd.get_dummies(). It throws a 'pd is not defined' error. It's a pretty small bug that is easily fixed by adding 'pd' as part of the global variables passed to safe_exec while running the default_output_processor.\r\n\r\nI was able to create a new default_output_processor, pass that to PandasQueryEngine, and make it work just fine. There were no glaring issues that I could find. Please suggest any other unit tests/integration tests I could write for the default_output_processor function.\r\n\r\nThis is my first time contributing to llama-index. If there is anything that I have missed, my apologies, please let me know and I will do my best to add those as well.\r\n\r\nFixes #3241 and #12239 \r\n\r\n## New Package?\r\n\r\nDid I fill in the `tool.llamahub` section in the `pyproject.toml` and provide a detailed README.md for my new integration or package?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [X] No\r\n\r\n## Version Bump?\r\n\r\nDid I bump the version in the `pyproject.toml` file of the package I am updating? (Except for the `llama-index-core` package)\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [X] No\r\n\r\n## Type of Change\r\n\r\nPlease delete options that are not relevant.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n\r\n## How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nPlease describe the tests that you ran to verify your changes. Provide instructions so we can reproduce. Please also list any relevant details for your test configuration\r\n\r\n- [X] I stared at the code and made sure it makes sense\r\n\r\n## Suggested Checklist:\r\n\r\n- [X] I have performed a self-review of my own code\r\n- [X] I have commented my code, particularly in hard-to-understand areas\r\n- [ ] I have made corresponding changes to the documentation\r\n- [ ] I have added Google Colab support for the newly added notebooks.\r\n- [X] My changes generate no new warnings\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] New and existing unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I ran `make format; make lint` to appease the lint gods\r\n",

This PR just wraps the `completions.create()` calls within a client context manager and ensures that the underlying `httpx.AsyncClient` used by the OpenAI python client is properly opened and closed.\r\n\r\nFor completeness, `completion.create()` requests from the Sync OpenAI client are also wrapped in a client context manager. This PR also aligns the `_achat()` method to return logprobs similar to `_chat()` method.\r\n\r\nFixes issues raised in https://github.com/openai/openai-python/pull/1262, https://github.com/openai/openai-python/issues/1254\r\n\r\n## New Package?\r\n\r\nDid I fill in the `tool.llamahub` section in the `pyproject.toml` and provide a detailed README.md for my new integration or package?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [x] No\r\n\r\n## Version Bump?\r\n\r\nDid I bump the version in the `pyproject.toml` file of the package I am updating? (Except for the `llama-index-core` package)\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [x] No\r\n\r\n## Type of Change\r\n\r\nPlease delete options that are not relevant.\r\n\r\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] This change requires a documentation update\r\n\r\n## How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nPlease describe the tests that you ran to verify your changes. Provide instructions so we can reproduce. Please also list any relevant details for your test configuration\r\n\r\n- [ ] Added new unit/integration tests\r\n- [ ] Added new notebook (that tests end-to-end)\r\n- [x] I stared at the code and made sure it makes sense\r\n- [x] I implemented it in my project code and it resolves the RuntimeError \r\n\r\n## Suggested Checklist:\r\n\r\n- [x] I have performed a self-review of my own code\r\n- [ ] I have commented my code, particularly in hard-to-understand areas\r\n- [ ] I have made corresponding changes to the documentation\r\n- [ ] I have added Google Colab support for the newly added notebooks.\r\n- [x] My changes generate no new warnings\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] New and existing unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I ran `make format; make lint` to appease the lint gods\r\n",

Added a check at the beginning of the add method to return early if the input list is empty.\r\n\r\n### Correcting Field Name in delete Method\r\nThe delete method uses an incorrect field name (document_id) for deletion, the field name is set [here](https://github.com/run-llama/llama_index/blob/00f014b258c0f654c1ba8f8aba332c9e19bf9d0c/llama-index-integrations/vector_stores/llama-index-vector-stores-lancedb/llama_index/vector_stores/lancedb/base.py#L168), when deleting it should use the same field name.\r\n\r\n## Version Bump?\r\n\r\nDid I bump the version in the `pyproject.toml` file of the package I am updating? (Except for the `llama-index-core` package)\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [x] No\r\n\r\n## Type of Change\r\n\r\nPlease delete options that are not relevant.\r\n\r\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] This change requires a documentation update\r\n\r\n## How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nPlease describe the tests that you ran to verify your changes.

        "body": "# Description\r\n\r\nPlease include a summary of the change and which issue is fixed. Please also include relevant motivation and context. List any dependencies that are required for this change.\r\n\r\nThe modification here aims to resolve an issue with the Google Drive loader. When there are multiple files with the same name in your folder, not all files are retrieved. This happens because the loader uses the filename for downloading, causing files to be overwritten.\r\n\r\nIn this Pull Request, we've shifted from using the filename to using the file ID, ensuring uniqueness and proper functionality.\r\n\r\n## Version Bump?\r\n\r\nDid I bump the version in the `pyproject.toml` file of the package I am updating? (Except for the `llama-index-core` package)\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [x] No\r\n\r\n## Type of Change\r\n\r\nPlease delete options that are not relevant.\r\n\r\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] This change requires a documentation update\r\n\r\n## How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nPlease describe the tests that you ran to verify your changes. Provide instructions so we can reproduce. Please also list any relevant details for your test configuration\r\n\r\nThis update, which connects to Google, should be covered by existing tests. However, if you wish to test it yourself, I've added a 'folder_id' with 15 files. The previous code would return 10 files, but now it will return all 15. Additionally, I have included regular tests for all readers in the Google folder.\r\n\r\nYou can run the following code for testing:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfrom llama_index.readers.google import GoogleDriveReader\r\n\r\nloader = GoogleDriveReader(credentials_path=GDRIVE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT)\r\n\r\ndef load_data(folder_id: str):\r\n    docs = loader.load_data(folder_id=folder_id)\r\n    for doc in docs:\r\n        doc.id_ = doc.metadata[\"file name\"]\r\n    return docs\r\n\r\ndocuments = load_data(folder_id=\"1NIGvjHBuUQHWnMqzboyg-zLI1q_bOuCH\")\r\n\r\nprint(len(documents))\r\n```\r\n\r\nPS: if someone write a mock tests for this would be appreciated. \r\n\r\n- [x] Added new unit/integration tests\r\n- [ ] Added new notebook (that tests end-to-end)\r\n- [ ] I stared at the code and made sure it makes sense\r\n\r\n## Suggested Checklist:\r\n\r\n- [x] I have performed a self-review of my own code\r\n- [x] I have commented my code, particularly in hard-to-understand areas\r\n- [] I have made corresponding changes to the documentation\r\n- [ ] I have added Google Colab support for the newly added notebooks.\r\n- [x] My changes generate no new warnings\r\n- [] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [x] New and existing unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [x] I ran `make format; make lint` to appease the lint gods\r\n",

We just found this issue recently, i guess because default file metadata has been added more metadata fields. We already tested with a purge store, but it still happens. I think it'd better if we add a default value for all metadata attributes or exclude the null attribute in there. \r\n\r\nSo, in this PR i updated the code to exclude the null value. Because the document metadata is just a map type so i think that this change will not affect other stores.\r\n\r\nPlease help me to review that, thank you!\r\n\r\ncc @marcusschiesser @thucpn \r\n\r\n## Type of Change\r\n\r\nPlease delete options that are not relevant.\r\n\r\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] This change requires a documentation update\r\n\r\n# How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nPlease describe the tests that you ran to verify your changes.

(Except for the `llama-index-core` package)\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [x] No\r\n\r\n## Type of Change\r\n\r\nPlease delete options that are not relevant.\r\n\r\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] This change requires a documentation update\r\n\r\n## How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nPlease describe the tests that you ran to verify your changes. Provide instructions so we can reproduce. Please also list any relevant details for your test configuration\r\n\r\n- [ ] Added new unit/integration tests\r\n- [ ] Added new notebook (that tests end-to-end)\r\n- [x] I stared at the code and made sure it makes sense + made sure my RAG app works now\r\n\r\n## Suggested Checklist:\r\n\r\n- [x] I have performed a self-review of my own code\r\n- [ ] I have commented my code, particularly in hard-to-understand areas\r\n- [ ] I have made corresponding changes to the documentation\r\n- [ ] I have added Google Colab support for the newly added notebooks.\r\n- [x] My changes generate no new warnings\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [x] New and existing unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [x] I ran `make format; make lint` to appease the lint gods\r\n",

We've found that `MessageRole.USER` works so, in our own codebase, we've extended the `Vertex` class to overwrite the `metadata` property, allowing us to set `system_role=MessageRole.USER`. This Pull Request provides that change for everyone, thus avoiding our need to extend the Vertex class and avoiding the error:\r\n```\r\nValueError: Gemini model don't support system messages\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt's possible that another `MessageRole` makes better sense for Vertex's default.

        "body": "# Description\r\n\r\nThe Qdrant Vector DB integration was using `recreate_collection` instead of `create_collection`.\r\n\r\nThe `recreate_collection` *deletes* the collection if it already exists and creates an empty new collection. This is fine in cases where you're just running a notebook since you just have one thread writing into the vector store. Thats because this integration does its own check to see if the collection already exists before calling `recreate_collection`. However, if you are in a situation with multiple writers each doing parallel writes, this becomes problematic since there could be a race condition where they both check if the collection exist at the same time, but then one writer inserts nodes after that only for them to get wiped out by the other writer that does `recreate_collection`. Probably a highly improbable race condition but easy to handle properly.\r\n\r\n## Type of Change\r\n\r\nPlease delete options that are not relevant.\r\n\r\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n\r\n# How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nPlease describe the tests that you ran to verify your changes.

        "body": "# Description\n\nCreate the `relationships` object only once. Otherwise, it recomputes the whole text's hash for every node. It is very inefficient for long text.\n\nAn alternative approach would be to cache the hash property. However, it wasn't so straightforward as `Document` isn't a cacheable type. I also do not know Python very well, maybe it would be enough to store a simple null and if it isn't null, then don't recompute? However, the most important reason is I'm not sure about the side effects and the existing assumption that the node is mutable and the hash always reflects the state during the call (unless we modify the object in multiple threads). This change doesn't break any assumptions. If the document was modified while we were creating nodes extracted from it, something would be very wrong.\n\nFixes #10554\n\n## Type of Change\n\nPlease delete options that are not relevant.\n\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\n- [ ] This change requires a documentation update\n\n# How Has This Been Tested?\n\nLocal benchmarks taken on a document attached to the bug:\n\nBefore: Execution time for build_nodes_from_splits: 53.69 seconds\n\nAfter: Execution time for build_nodes_from_splits: 0.18 seconds\n\n\n- [ ] Added new unit/integration tests\n- [ ] Added new notebook (that tests end-to-end)\n- [x] I stared at the code and made sure it makes sense\n\n# Suggested Checklist:\n\n- [x] I have performed a self-review of my own code\n- [x] I have commented my code, particularly in hard-to-understand areas\n- [ ] I have made corresponding changes to the documentation\n- [ ] I have added Google Colab support for the newly added notebooks.\n- [x] My changes generate no new warnings\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\n- [x] New and existing unit tests pass locally with my changes\n- [x] I ran `make format; make lint` to appease the lint gods\n",

Adding a sleep within the loop unblocks the thread allowing the chat to stream as expected.\r\nWithout this fix, each iteration severely hangs.\r\n\r\n## Type of Change\r\n\r\nPlease delete options that are not relevant.\r\n\r\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n\r\n# How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nThis has been tested within my application which uses llamaindex. My application runs in a separate worker thread which runs properly with all other streaming agents outside of llama index. When I use chat_stream with llama index, it hangs. This code fixes the issue.\r\n\r\n# Suggested Checklist:\r\n\r\n- [x] I have performed a self-review of my own code\r\n- [x] My changes generate no new warnings\r\n",

This method is general purpose enough and is written to handle combinations of sync and async functions in a single tool spec. \r\n\r\nThe resultant FunctionTool contains both sync and async methods, even if the actual tool spec did not contain a sync version of the function. This is achieved by patching a sync version from the async version.\r\n\r\n**Issue**:  The `func_sync` and `func_async` variables are not reset inside the loop every time. This makes it such that if there is a combination of sync and async function specifications, the \"sync\" version of the function tool actually points to a different function.\r\n\r\n**Proposed fix**: Resets func_sync and func_async variables every time a new function specification is being processed.\r\n\r\nFixes # (issue)\r\n\r\n## Type of Change\r\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n\r\n# How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Added new unit/integration tests\r\n- [ ] Added new notebook (that tests end-to-end)\r\n- [x] I stared at the code and made sure it makes sense (also used this fix in another repo that I maintain)\r\n\r\n# Suggested Checklist:\r\n\r\n- [x] I have performed a self-review of my own code\r\n- [ ] I have commented my code, particularly in hard-to-understand areas\r\n- [ ] I have made corresponding changes to the documentation\r\n- [ ] I have added Google Colab support for the newly added notebooks.\r\n- [ ] My changes generate no new warnings\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] New and existing unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I ran `make format; make lint` to appease the lint gods\r\n",

So that's expensive and unnecessary.\r\n- The `ts_query` variable we put on the `SELECT` clause will only compiled to `plainto_tsquery($1, $2::VARCHAR)`, which does not do anything other than convert the query to `tsquery` type. So we still need to put the `WHERE` clause to actually filter the result.\r\n\r\nPerformance comparison (you can see the execution time is almost 2x faster):\r\n\r\n**Without `WHERE` clause:**\r\n```\r\nQUERY PLAN                                                                                                                                                    |\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\nLimit  (cost=61005.45..61017.12 rows=100 width=1191) (actual time=627.584..629.058 rows=100 loops=1)                                                          |\r\n  ->  Gather Merge  (cost=61005.45..88736.49 rows=237678 width=1191) (actual time=627.582..629.048 rows=100 loops=1)                                          |\r\n        Workers Planned: 2                                                                                                                                    |\r\n        Workers Launched: 2                                                                                                                                   |\r\n        ->  Sort  (cost=60005.43..60302.53 rows=118839 width=1191) (actual time=624.766..624.770 rows=64 loops=3)                                             |\r\n              Sort Key: (ts_rank(text_search_tsv, '''china'''::tsquery)) DESC                                                                                 |\r\n              Sort Method: top-N heapsort  Memory: 252kB                                                                                                      |\r\n              Worker 0:  Sort Method: top-N heapsort  Memory: 244kB                                                                                           |\r\n              Worker 1:  Sort Method: top-N heapsort  Memory: 270kB                                                                                           |\r\n              ->  Parallel Seq Scan on my_table                   (cost=0.00..55463.49 rows=118839 width=1191) (actual time=0.072..578.646 rows=95071 loops=3)|\r\nPlanning Time: 0.094 ms                                                                                                                                       |\r\nExecution Time: 629.090 ms                                                                                                                                    |\r\n```\r\n\r\n**With `WHERE` clause:**\r\n```\r\nQUERY PLAN                                                                                                                                               |\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\nLimit  (cost=55709.26..55709.51 rows=100 width=1191) (actual time=306.273..306.289 rows=100 loops=1)                                                     |\r\n  ->  Sort  (cost=55709.26..55803.64 rows=37753 width=1191) (actual time=306.272..306.278 rows=100 loops=1)                                              |\r\n        Sort Key: (ts_rank(text_search_tsv, '''china'''::tsquery)) DESC                                                                                  |\r\n        Sort Method: top-N heapsort  Memory: 334kB                                                                                                       |\r\n        ->  Bitmap Heap Scan on my_table  (cost=2220.58..54266.37 rows=37753 width=1191) (actual time=9.637..287.518 rows=36933 loops=1)                 |\r\n              Recheck Cond: (text_search_tsv @@ '''china'''::tsquery)                                                                                    |\r\n              Heap Blocks: exact=21136                                                                                                                   |\r\n              ->  Bitmap Index Scan on text_search_tsv_idx  (cost=0.00..2211.15 rows=37753 width=0) (actual time=6.226..6.226 rows=40473 loops=1)        |\r\n                    Index Cond: (text_search_tsv @@ '''china'''::tsquery)                                                                                |\r\nPlanning Time: 0.134 ms                                                                                                                                  |\r\nExecution Time: 306.325 ms                                                                                                                               |\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nFixes #

        "body": "## Description\r\n\r\n**Summary of Change:**  \r\nThis PR introduces a crucial update to the SubQuestionQueryEngine in version 0.9.1.post1. It addresses a specific bug where the engine failed to default to the SubQuestionOutputParser when modifying the prompt without explicitly specifying the `output_parser`. This enhancement ensures more reliable and streamlined functionality in prompt handling.\r\n\r\n**Context and Motivation:**  \r\nThe necessity for this update stems from the observed behavior where, in the absence of an explicitly assigned `output_parser`, the engine did not resort to the default SubQuestionOutputParser. This led to an `AssertionError`, hindering the usability and flexibility of the SubQuestionQueryEngine.\r\n\r\n**Dependencies:**  \r\nNo additional dependencies are required for this change.\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Define `SubQuestionQueryEngine` with the necessary parameters.\r\n2. Update the query engine's prompt using `PromptTemplate` without specifying `output_parser`.\r\n   Example code snippet:\r\n   ```python\r\n   from llama_index.prompts import PromptTemplate\r\n   from llama_index.question_gen.output_parser import SubQuestionOutputParser\r\n\r\n   # Example prompt template string\r\n   new_prompt_tmpl_str = \"\"\"...\"\"\"\r\n\r\n   new_prompt_tmpl = PromptTemplate(\r\n       new_prompt_tmpl_str\r\n       # Previously, output_parser was not specified here\r\n   )\r\n   sq_query_engine.update_prompts({\"question_gen:question_gen_prompt\": new_prompt_tmpl})\r\n\r\n## Notice\r\n\r\nThe absence of `output_parser = SubQuestionOutputParser()` in the prompt update process results in an `AssertionError`.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\n**Implemented Change:**  \r\nThe `_update_prompts` function within the `SubQuestionQueryEngine` class has been updated. This change ensures that if the `output_parser` is not explicitly assigned, it will default to `SubQuestionOutputParser`. This modification effectively resolves the issue and ensures the functionality aligns with expected behaviors.\r\n\r\n**Developer Interaction:**  \r\nDevelopers are now able to update prompts without needing to specify the `output_parser` each time. The engine automatically defaults to the appropriate parser, simplifying the development process.\r\n\r\n**Code Example of the Change:**\r\n```python\r\ndef _update_prompts(self, prompts: PromptDictType) -> None:\r\n    \"\"\"Update prompts.\"\"\"\r\n    if \"question_gen_prompt\" in prompts:\r\n        output_parser = prompts[\"question_gen_prompt\"].output_parser\r\n        if output_parser is None:\r\n            output_parser = SubQuestionOutputParser()\r\n        new_prompt = PromptTemplate(\r\n            prompts[\"question_gen_prompt\"].template_str,\r\n            output_parser=output_parser\r\n        )\r\n        self._prompt = new_prompt\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFixes # (issue) #9759 \r\n\r\n\r\n## Type of Change\r\n\r\nPlease delete options that are not relevant.\r\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n\r\n# How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nPlease describe the tests that you ran to verify your changes. Provide instructions so we can reproduce. Please also list any relevant details for your test configuration\r\n\r\n- [ ] Added new unit/integration tests\r\n- [ ] Added new notebook (that tests end-to-end)\r\n- [ ] I stared at the code and made sure it makes sense\r\n- [x] I created a notebook that utilizes the SubQuestionQueryEngine and attempted to replicate the bug by not explicitly specifying the output parser in the PromptTemplate. I used the `_update_prompt` method of the SubQuestionQueryEngine object, and now it functions correctly.\r\n\r\n# Suggested Checklist:\r\n\r\n- [x] I have performed a self-review of my own code\r\n- [ ] I have commented my code, particularly in hard-to-understand areas\r\n- [ ] I have made corresponding changes to the documentation\r\n- [ ] I have added Google Colab support for the newly added notebooks.\r\n- [x] My changes generate no new warnings\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] New and existing unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I ran `make format; make lint` to appease the lint gods\r\n",

The update ensures that when a service context is not specified, it correctly defaults to the global context using ServiceContext.from_defaults(), replacing the previous erroneous call to _get_default_service_context().\r\n\r\nContext and Motivation:\r\nThe fix was motivated by the inconsistency and unexpected behavior encountered in the application due to the incorrect initialization of the default service context. This change ensures adherence to the intended default settings, enhancing the reliability of the service context management.\r\n\r\nDependencies:\r\nNo additional dependencies are introduced with this change.\r\n\r\nFixes  #9774 \r\n\r\n\r\nPlease delete options that are not relevant.\r\n\r\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n\r\n# How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Added new unit/integration tests\r\n- [ ] Added new notebook (that tests end-to-end)\r\n- [ ] I stared at the code and made sure it makes sense\r\n- [x] I have tested locally\r\n\r\n# Suggested Checklist:\r\n\r\n- [x] I have performed a self-review of my own code\r\n- [ ] I have commented my code, particularly in hard-to-understand areas\r\n- [ ] I have made corresponding changes to the documentation\r\n- [ ] I have added Google Colab support for the newly added notebooks.\r\n- [x] My changes generate no new warnings\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] New and existing unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I ran `make format; make lint` to appease the lint gods\r\n",

The `formatted` param is an internal param for the ollama llama-index client while the `format` param is for the ollama API (see [here](https://github.com/jmorganca/ollama/blob/86b0dd4b165497e08ec331e3c2c2aa229beb09db/docs/api.md#generate-a-completion)\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes this issue. Also some code refactoring was done to the ollama client code. All ollama API params needs to be passed in the `additional_kwargs` param as is now removing any confusion of where and how to pass additonal params.\r\n\r\n## Type of Change\r\n\r\nPlease delete options that are not relevant.\r\n\r\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n\r\n# How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nPlease describe the tests that you ran to verify your changes.

Before it just str(scored_node), which makes agent really confused\r\n\r\n## Change in a Glance\r\n- Considering we have following docs/node to retrieve:\r\n```\r\n[Document(id_='...', embedding=None, metadata={'file_path': '/data/personal/essay.md'}, ..., text='# title1:Hello world.\\nThis is a test.\\n', ...),\r\n Document(id_='...', embedding=None, metadata={'file_path': '/data/personal/essay.md'}, ..., text='# title2:This is another test.\\nThis is a test v2.', ...)]\r\n```\r\n- Before: retriever.output.content shows simply str(docs), looks like following:\r\n```\r\n\"[NodeWithScore(node=TextNode(id_='e8a04fff-8674-44e5-8628-2d1bacafd8c0', embedding=None, metadata={'file_path': '/data/personal/essay.md'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={<NodeRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='fe85c756-359f-4b41-83a5-8ea623c41c02', node_type=<ObjectType.DOCUMENT: '4'>, metadata={'file_path': '/data/personal/essay.md'}, hash='0c0dad0d2c2a3be7d4cbc156ca42cbfccd2f029eddb69d0ec3af021330648951')}, hash='0c0dad0d2c2a3be7d4cbc156ca42cbfccd2f029eddb69d0ec3af021330648951', text='# title2:This is another test.\\\\nThis is a test v2.', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\\\n\\\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\\\n'), score=1.0), \r\nNodeWithScore(node=TextNode(id_='f9bb8bd9-a26d-44e4-b2f1-23e239ea32c3', embedding=None, metadata={'file_path': '/data/personal/essay.md'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={<NodeRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='276c0bbf-7e07-4b81-aac4-98c871b48f42', node_type=<ObjectType.DOCUMENT: '4'>, metadata={'file_path': '/data/personal/essay.md'}, hash='05afed27a3aba61c68c2cd48e140a726d9f0dba877b67b310ccbe614e7f43154')}, hash='21de075519145210f29669b9989036db29e112a7dff15a80f3f5674b23718dac', text='# title1:Hello world.\\\\nThis is a test.', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\\\n\\\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\\\n'), score=1.0)]\"\r\n```\r\n- Current: it format the content, and the output looks like this:\r\n```\r\nfile_path = [/data/personal/essay.md](https://file+.vscode-resource.vscode-cdn.net/data/personal/essay.md)\r\n# title2:This is another test.\r\nThis is a test v2.\r\n\r\nfile_path = [/data/personal/essay.md](https://file+.vscode-resource.vscode-cdn.net/data/personal/essay.md)\r\n# title1:Hello world.\r\nThis is a test.\r\n```\r\n- below is the code that does the formatting :\r\n```python\r\n        content = \"\"\r\n        for doc in docs:\r\n            node_copy = doc.node.copy()\r\n            node_copy.text_template = \"{metadata_str}\\n{content}\"\r\n            node_copy.metadata_template = \"{key} = {value}\"\r\n            content += node_copy.get_content(MetadataMode.LLM) + \"\\n\\n\"\r\n```\r\n## Validation \r\nThe validation is hard to do in unit test, because it is not like the previous content throw error. The problem is that when I use retriever_tool in REACT AGENT, the agent gets confused by too many object information.\r\nStill, I added a unit test to test the formatting .\r\n\r\n## Type of Change\r\n\r\nPlease delete options that are not relevant.\r\n\r\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] This change requires a documentation update\r\n\r\n# How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nPlease describe the tests that you ran to verify your changes.

List any dependencies that are required for this change.\r\n\r\nThe Problem:\r\n* Currently, postgres vector store always returns nodes as `TextNode`. When an IndexNode is added to the vector store, although the IndexNode is stored as raw JSON successfully, it is always returned as a `TextNode`.\r\n* While I have identified this problem using postgres vector store, I assume other vector stores behave similarly, as the function from `vector_stores.utils` consistently returns `TextNode`.\r\n* This problem limits the use of the vector store when implementing advanced RAG strategies, such as handling tabular data with `RecursiveRetriever` or using `UnstructuredElementNodeParser`, as it returns both TextNode and `IndexNode`.\r\n\r\nThe FIX:\r\n* When saving a node to the vector store, save the node type as `_node_type` along with `_node_content`.\r\n* If `_node_type` exists, check `_node_type` and return the corresponding Node object.\r\n\r\nFixes #8240 \r\n\r\n## Type of Change\r\n\r\nPlease delete options that are not relevant.\r\n\r\n- [X] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] This change requires a documentation update\r\n\r\n# How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nPlease describe the tests that you ran to verify your changes. Provide instructions so we can reproduce. Please also list any relevant details for your test configuration\r\n\r\n- [X] Added new unit/integration tests\r\n- [ ] Added new notebook (that tests end-to-end)\r\n- [X] I stared at the code and made sure it makes sense\r\n\r\n# Suggested Checklist:\r\n\r\n- [X] I have performed a self-review of my own code\r\n- [X] I have commented my code, particularly in hard-to-understand areas\r\n- [ ] I have made corresponding changes to the documentation\r\n- [ ] My changes generate no new warnings\r\n- [X] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [X] New and existing unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [X] I ran `make format; make lint` to appease the lint gods\r\n",
